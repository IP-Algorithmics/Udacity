Code Practice with Accompanying Videos
Hi there! I'm Eddy Shyu, an instructor here at Udacity. 
I'll be walking you through some code exercises for the rest of this lesson. Each video will give an introduction to the task you'll be asked to do, or some conceptual explanation with some visuals. 
After that, please try out the code exercise on your own. When you're done, or if you get stuck, feel free to continue to the next video, in which I'll walk through and explain the solution. I hope you have fun! -Eddy
