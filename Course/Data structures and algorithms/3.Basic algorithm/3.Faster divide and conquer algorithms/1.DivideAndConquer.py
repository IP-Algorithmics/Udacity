Divide and conquer
In this section, we'll discuss algorithms that use a strategy called divide and conquer to solve problems more efficiently. 
The name comes from the idea that the algorithm will break (or divide) the problem down into sub-problems that can be more easily solved (or conquered). 
Then, the solutions to these sub-problems are combined to yield an answer to the original problem.

Over the next several videos, Eric will walk through an exampleâ€”specifically, he'll demonstrate how to use a divide and conquer algorithm to efficiently find the median element out of a collection of unsorted numbers. 
Following this, you'll have the opportunity to do some hands-on work and solve several different problems using a divide-and-conquer approach.

Additional Read - The problem of finding kth smallest element from an unsorted array is generally called as kth order statistic. 
The BFPRT (1973) solution mentioned above is widely known as Median of medians(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians), that we will discuss in the next video.
