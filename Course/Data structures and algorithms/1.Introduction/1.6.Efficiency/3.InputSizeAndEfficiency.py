Order
We should note that when people refer to the rate of increase of an algorithm, they will sometimes instead use the term order. Or to put that another way:
The rate of increase of an algorithm is also referred to as the order of the algorithm.
For example, instead of saying "this relationship has a linear rate of increase", we could instead say, "the order of this relationship is linear".
On the next page, we'll introduce something called Big O Notation, and you'll see that the "O" in the name refers to the order of the rate of increase.
