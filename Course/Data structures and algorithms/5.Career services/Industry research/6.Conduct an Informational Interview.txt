What is an informational interview?
After performing your own career and industry research, the natural progression of building upon this knowledge is talking to people, in order to learn from them. Usually, an informational interview is a one-on-one informal meeting, phone call or video conference where you lead a conversation with someone who is currently working in a role, company, or industry you are interested in.

Why is it useful?
Being able to speak with those already working in the industry will allow you to confirm or refute the information you've collected on your own. It is an opportunity for you to learn about company culture, responsibilities of a role from an internal perspective, industry prospects, or even open positions at the company. Informational interviews are also a great way to make new professional connections and expand your network, whether youâ€™re currently active on the job market or not.
