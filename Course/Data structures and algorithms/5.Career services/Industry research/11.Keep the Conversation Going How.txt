How to Keep the Conversation Going
Now that youâ€™ve made a personal connection, keep it going! Send a thank you note within 24 hours; email is fine! If anything particularly memorable happened during your conversation, you may want to mention it in order to reinforce that you were actively listening and engaged.

When sending your thank you email, send your resume so they can introduce you to others and remember who you are. Over time, keep in touch through holiday greetings, sharing information about topics of interest, and keeping them posted on progress in your job search. People like to help others and hear that they are making a positive impact!

Final Takeaways
The most common questions about informational interviews stem from entering a new industry and uncertainty about how to make new connections.

To address these concerns, remember:

People generally want to help! It is a chance to give back, network and simply share excitement and information about a job. You will likely be surprised by people's willingness to share.
Start building relationships as soon as possible; these are long-term relationships that will require some nurturing.
Take advantage of your Udacity community. Classmates, instructors, and support staff are all a part of your network.
Get out of your comfort zone and learn to be proactive about asking. The worst that can happen is that someone declines or does not respond to your request. But there will be people who don't decline and will respond!
Be optimistic and resourceful. Informational interviews are great learning experiences and practice for future job interviews.
