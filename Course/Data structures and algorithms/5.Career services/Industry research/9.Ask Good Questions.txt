Prepare Interview Questions
After you've set up an informational interview, prepare yourself to ensure you make the most of your learning opportunity. We recommend doing preliminary research on both the company and the individual, drafting sample questions, and practicing beforehand.

Below are a few guidelines:

Come prepared with smart, relevant questions. If you can find the answer to your question on the person's LinkedIn profile, in a Google search, or on the company website, you can be fairly confident that it won’t be the best question to ask.
Opt for open-ended questions with potential for insightful answers.
Before the interview, create a sample question list.
During the interview, take notes on the information you learn and be mindful of your goals.
Ask clarifying questions as needed.
Goals
Be goal-oriented throughout the interview. Think of a few outcomes you would like to achieve at the end of the interview. For example, your goal may be to build your network, find more contacts, or access insider information about company and culture.

We also recommend approaching the interview as an opportunity to gain recommendations for resources (blogs, books, etc.) relevant to your industry.

Finally, make it a goal to leave a positive impression. Even if your new contact isn’t able to directly help you advance in your job search right now, you never know when they may think of you for a future opportunity.
