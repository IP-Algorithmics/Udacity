Communicate Your Elevator Pitch in your LinkedIn Summary
Let's take another look at Chris's elevator pitch:

“Hi, I’m Chris, a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves building education products. I recently developed a web app using AngularJS that lets teachers share student writing samples anonymously. I’d love to combine my passion for learning and teaching with my software development skills to continue building personalized learning products for people.”

Use the same talking points for your LinkedIn summary, which may be the first thing people read on your profile. When recruiters (or anyone else) search on LinkedIn, keywords from your summary contribute to your rank in search results.

LinkedIn Summary Guidelines
Keep the summary to 3-5 points maximum.
Use numbers where possible.
Always use active instead of passive language.
Include a call to action so that people are more likely to contact you for more information.
