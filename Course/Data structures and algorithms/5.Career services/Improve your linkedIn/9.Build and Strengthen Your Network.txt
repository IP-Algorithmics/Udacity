Find More Connections
In order to use your LinkedIn profile effectively, it's important to have as many connections as possible. In general, 500+ connections are needed to fully optimize your profile.

This may seem like a lot, but once you get rolling, you'll get to that number fast. After you actively start engaging on LinkedIn, by joining groups and going to networking events, your number of connections will climb. You are more likely to show up in search results on LinkedIn if you have more connections, which means you'll be more visible to recruiters.

Here are some examples of the types of connections you could add:

current and former colleagues
people you attended school with (high school, university, graduate school, Udacity)
your favorite teachers and professors
people you meet at professional events, like conferences and meetups
volunteering companions
friends and relatives
roommates and neighbors

Join Groups
Joining groups allows you to see content from and post content to people who share your interests. Join groups which relate to your industry, of professionals who live near you, or of people who attended the same alma mater. For example, it is common for people to join location-based professional groups, like the Chicago Young Professionals, or for Udacity students to join the Udacity Alumni Network. You might want to join groups associated with specific technologies, like Swift Developers, User Interface Design, or Self-Driving Cars.

Joining groups vastly increases the number of people in your network, increasing the visibility of your profile and the number of opportunities that come your way.
