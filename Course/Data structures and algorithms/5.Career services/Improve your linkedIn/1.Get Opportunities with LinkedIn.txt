Why Use LinkedIn for Networking?
Employers Flock to LinkedIn
In the U.S. alone,

149 million workers have LinkedIn profiles.
20,000+ companies recruit on LinkedIn.
Over 3 million jobs are posted a month.
Using LinkedIn is a smarter way to build your professional network. Did you know, 40% of jobs are hired through referrals?! Ensure you're connecting with others across your field using LinkedIn - they'll help you find your next job and grow professionally.

No Resubmission Required
Unlike other Nanodegree projects, you submit to a Career Service once to get feedback and do not need to meet specifications to continue on in your program. We highly encourage you to take advantage of this guidance; most Alumni who report jobs and other opportunities (such as collaboration) attribute their success to networking.

Let's Get Started
Submit your LinkedIn profile and receive in-depth and honest feedback from a Career Reviewer. They'll ensure you're presenting your best self to your network.

Resources
We recommend reviewing these resources before submitting for feedback to ensure your LinkedIn profile is ready for review.

Career Review Requirement
Your Nanodegree program was designed to ensure your long-term success in the field, and to pursue a successful career you must showcase the skills youâ€™ve learned to employers effectively. Therefore, this is a requirement for graduation.

Opting Out
If improving your LinkedIn profile does not currently align with your Nanodegree goals, you may opt-out of this graduation requirement.
