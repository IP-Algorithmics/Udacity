The Tech World Has Adopted GitHub
In 2017, GitHub saw:

1.5 million organizations using the platform
24 million users across 200 countries, from entrepreneurs to open source contributors to company employees
25.3 million active repositories
47 million pull requests, which means people and organizations are working together
Software engineers, developers, and data scientists at most companies use GitHub daily to house their work, read each other's documentation, and collaborate across teams and organizations.

Recruiters, hiring managers, and senior engineers search through GitHub for potential job candidates. Your GitHub profile - activity, repos, commits, documentation - provides evidence that you're a skilled engineer.

Udacity graduate Ryan Waite was hired based on the strength of his GitHub profile.

No Resubmission Required
Unlike other Nanodegree projects, you submit to a Career Service once to get feedback and do not need to meet specifications to continue on in your program. We highly encourage you to take advantage of this guidance; most Alumni who report jobs and other opportunities (such as collaboration) attribute their success to networking.

Career Review Requirement
Your Nanodegree program was designed to ensure your long-term success in the field, and to pursue a successful career you must showcase the skills youâ€™ve learned to employers effectively. Therefore, this is a requirement for graduation, unless you opt-out.

Opting Out
If improving your GitHub profile does not currently align with your Nanodegree goals, you may opt-out of this graduation requirement.
